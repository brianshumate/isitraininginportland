<title>PRISM Statement :: Is it raining in Portland?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Dear Is it Raining in Portland? users, </p>

<p>You may be aware of reports alleging that Is it Raining in Portland? and several other Internet companies have joined a secret U.S. government program called PRISM to give the National Security Agency direct access to our servers. We would like to respond to the press reports, and give you the facts. </p>

<p>Is it Raining in Portland? is not and has never been part of any program to give the US or any other government direct access to our servers. We have never received a blanket request or court order from any government agency asking for information or metadata in bulk, like the one Verizon reportedly received. We hadn't even heard of PRISM before yesterday. </p>

<p>When governments ask Is it Raining in Portland? for data, we review each request carefully to make sure they always follow the correct processes and all applicable laws, and then only provide the information if is required by law. We will continue fighting aggressively to keep your information safe and secure. Any suggestion that Is it Raining in Portland? is disclosing information about our users’ Internet activity on such a scale is completely false.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage all governments to be much more transparent about all programs aimed at keeping the public safe. It's the only way to protect everyone's civil liberties and create the safe and free society we all want over the long term. We here at Is it Raining in Portland? understand that the U.S. and other governments need to take action to protect their citizens’ safety—including sometimes by using surveillance. But the level of secrecy around the current legal procedures undermines the freedoms we all cherish.
